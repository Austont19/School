# Number Guessing game project
A simple game made within java

## Information
This project is a simple Number guessing game built on java throughout a course at my university
Its a basic program that allows you to guess between the numbers 1 and 100 and then tells you back
on the command prompt if you are either too high or too low and continues to narrow it down until
you get the right number. Throughout the game it counts your tries so once you eventually guess
the right number you will be told how many tries it took you to guess it.




## Technologies
The project was created with Net Beans IDE
Using Java 8

## Setup
